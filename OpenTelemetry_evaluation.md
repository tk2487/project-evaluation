## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? They are working on many different language versions at the same time but the JavaScript version is seeing the most progress with the Java version close behind.

1. What is the development environment? If you have any of the listed languages they are working on installed (Go, JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang) you should be able to contribute. <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? Whichever language version you decide to work on, the corresponding repository will have a contributing file that details how to get started and what programs you will need for that specific version. <br>

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? Yes. They have clear instructions and links to the download page. <br>

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. Yes. Each piece of code is commented that explains what it does. <br>

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). Since there is no information on this project on OpenHub, I took a look at some of the contributions and it seems there are at least 20,000 lines of code for each language version. <br>

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? Yes. There are tests but contributors are not required to write them. <br>



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? Yes. Each piece of code is clearly explained. <br>

1. Is there documentation about the design? No. Not directly in the code but on their website. <br>

	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? Not much discussion, only approving of requests. <br>

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? This project just isn't something I have the knowledge to use currently and without having a reason to use it, it will be hard to contribute to as well. So I don't think it's possible since I'm not familiar at all with the inner workings of this project. <br>
